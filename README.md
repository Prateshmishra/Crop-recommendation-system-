**#Crop Recommendation System.#**

**##Overview.##**

The Crop Recommendation System is a machine learning-based application that recommends the most suitable crops for specific regions based on environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil nutrient content including potassium, phosphorous, nitrogen, and pH value of the soil. The system employs ensemble learning, specifically the Bagging technique, to enhance prediction accuracy.
